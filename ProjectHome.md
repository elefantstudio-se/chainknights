A co-op multiplayer 2D physics-based platformer set in a gritty, hand-drawn Nordic-Punk world.

Disembowel your friends and enemies with a huge selection of battle-worn weaponry as a Chain Knight, one of an ancient order dedicated to upholding justice through massive bloodshed.

Clobber waves of fierce Nugs as you pile on more and better armor, and squabble with your compatriots over powerful artifacts of dismemberment!

Swing around destructible, hand-drawn levels with your mighty grapple-chain- or use it to swing your fellow Knights into (and straight through) hordes of enemies!

Wade through rivers of viscera on your jovial quest for grim vengeance!
